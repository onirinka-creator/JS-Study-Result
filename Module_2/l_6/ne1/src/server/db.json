The first portion of the video will be a rundown on where we might live, work, eat, and relax. The second portion (most of it) will be a summary of a livestream where I \"lived\" in Cyberpink 2077 for \"seven days\", which worked out to be 21 hours of real time.\n\nThe focus of the video will mostly be on the monotony of daily living, and the surprising ways in which doing a challenge like this created moments of empathy, nostalgia, frustration, and immersion in a relatively short amount of time.",
